OpenCV Cookbook Examples
=========================

| [Next: Chapter 1>](src/main/scala/opencv_cookbook/chapter01) |

Overview
--------

**OpenCV Cookbook Examples** illustrate use of OpenCV with [JavaCV][javacv]. The Examples started as a port of C++ code
from Robert Laganière's
book "[OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-2-computer-vision-application-programming-cookbook)"
. Later updated for the fourth edition of the
book "[OpenCV Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook Fourth Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/opencv-4-computer-vision-application-programming-cookbook-fourth-edition/9781789340723)"
. The examples in the book use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) C++ API. Here they are translated to
use [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv) and [JavaCPP-Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets)
APIs.

[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of several hundred algorithms for computer
vision and video analysis. OpenCV can be us on JVM using two approaches. First are
Java [wrappers provided by OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/desktop_java/java_dev_intro.html).
Second are wrappers based on [JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp) (C++ wrapper engine for JVM)
called [OpenCV JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets). There are also JavaCPP presets for other
computer vision related libraries like: [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/)
, [libdc1394](http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/)
, [PGR FlyCapture](http://www.ptgrey.com/products/pgrflycapture/), [OpenKinect](http://openkinect.org/)
, [videoInput](http://muonics.net/school/spring05/videoInput/)
, [ARToolKitPlus](http://studierstube.icg.tugraz.at/handheld_ar/artoolkitplus.php)
, [flandmark](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~uricamic/flandmark/), and [others](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets).
JavaCV combines libraries in JavaCPP Presets and add some additional functionality that makes them easier use on JVM.

The *OpenCV Cookbook Examples* project illustrates use of OpenCV through JavaCV and OpenCV JavaCPP Presets. The current
version is updated to match the second edition of the Robert Laganière's
book "[OpenCV Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-3-computer-vision-application-programming-cookbook)"
. It is intended for use with OpenCV v.4 (JavaCV v.1).

While code in the examples is primarily written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), one of the leading JVM languages.
It can be easily converted to Java and other languages running on JVM, for
instance, [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/). The use of the JavaCV API is very similar in most JVM languages. Some
examples are provided in Java version.


Quick Sample
------------

Here is a quick preview that compares an original C++ example with code in Scala and Java using JavaCV wrapper.

Here is the original C++ example that opens an image (without error checking), creates a window, displays image in the
window, and waits for 5 seconds before exiting.

```cpp
#include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgcodecs/imgcodecs.hpp>

int main() {
    // Read an image
    cv::Mat src = cv::imread("data/boldt.jpg");
    display(src, "Input")

	// Apply Laplacian filter
    cv::Mat dest;
    cv::Laplacian(src, dest, src.depth(), 1, 3, 0, BORDER_DEFAULT);
    display(dest, "Laplacian");

    // wait key for 5000 ms
    cv::waitKey(5000);

    return 1;
}

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

void display(Mat image, char* caption) {
    // Create image window named "My Image"
    cv::namedWindow(caption);

    // Show image on window
    cv::imshow(caption, image);
}
```

The above C++ example translated to Scala using JavaCV wrapper:

```scala
import javax.swing._
import org.bytedeco.javacv._
import org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_core._
import org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgcodecs._
import org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgproc._
import org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_core._

object MyFirstOpenCVApp extends App {

  // Read an image.
  val src = imread("data/boldt.jpg")
  display(src, "Input")

  // Apply Laplacian filter
  val dest = new Mat()
  Laplacian(src, dest, src.depth(), 1, 3, 0, BORDER_DEFAULT)
  display(dest, "Laplacian")

  //---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  /** Display `image` with given `caption`. */
  def display(image: Mat, caption: String): Unit = {
    // Create image window named "My Image."
    val canvas = new CanvasFrame(caption, 1)

    // Request closing of the application when the image window is closed.
    canvas.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)

    // Convert from OpenCV Mat to Java Buffered image for display
    val converter = new OpenCVFrameConverter.ToMat()
    // Show image on window
    canvas.showImage(converter.convert(image))
  }
}
```

Now the same example expressed in a Java. Note that use of JavaCV API is exactly the same as in Scala and Java code. The
only practical difference is that in Java code is more verbose, you have to explicitly provide type for each variable,
in Scala it is optional.

```java
import org.bytedeco.javacv.CanvasFrame;
import org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_core.Mat;

import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

import static opencv_cookbook.OpenCVUtilsJava.toBufferedImage;
import static org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_core.BORDER_DEFAULT;
import static org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgcodecs.imread;
import static org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgproc.Laplacian;

public class MyFirstOpenCVAppInJava {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Read an image.
        final Mat src = imread("data/boldt.jpg");
        display(src, "Input");

        // Apply Laplacian filter
        final Mat dest = new Mat();
        Laplacian(src, dest, src.depth(), 1, 3, 0, BORDER_DEFAULT);
        display(dest, "Laplacian");
    }

    //---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    static void display(Mat image, String caption) {
        // Create image window named "My Image".
        final CanvasFrame canvas = new CanvasFrame(caption, 1.0);

        // Request closing of the application when the image window is closed.
        canvas.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        // Convert from OpenCV Mat to Java Buffered image for display
        final BufferedImage bi = toBufferedImage(image);

        // Show image on window.
        canvas.showImage(bi);
    }
}
```

OpenCV Documentation is Your Friend
-----------------------------------

If you are looking for a particular OpenCV operation, use the [OpenCV documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/). The Quick
Search box is particularly helpful. The documentation contains descriptions of alternative ways how C/C++ OpenCV API can
be used.

How to use JavaCV Examples
--------------------------

The *OpenCV Cookbook Examples* project is intended as a companion to the Robert Laganière's
book "[OpenCV Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-3-computer-vision-application-programming-cookbook)"
. The recommended way is to read the Cookbook and refer to JavaCV examples when in doubt how to translate the Cookbook's
C++ code to JavaCV. The Cookbook provides explanation how the algorithms work. The JavaCV examples provide only very
brief comments related to specifics of JavaCV API.

The simplest way to use the JavaCV examples is to browse the code located in [src/main] online. You can also download it
to you computer either use Git or as a ZIP file.

With a minimal setup you can easily execute the examples on you own computer. This is one of the benefits of JavaCV - it
provides all binaries needed to run OpenCV on various platforms. The setup is explained in README
for [Chapter 1](src/main/scala/opencv_cookbook/chapter01).


Organization of the Example Code
--------------------------------

The code is organized into packages that correspond to chapters in the Cookbook 1st edition, for
instance [opencv_cookbook.chapter8](src/main/scala/opencv_cookbook/chapter08). It is quite similar to the 2nd edition.
Individual examples roughly correspond to sections within each chapter of the book.

[Chapter 1](src/main/scala/opencv_cookbook/chapter01) describes IDE setup to run the examples, gives a basic example of
loading and displaying an image, and an example of a basic GUI that does basic image processing.

Why Scala?
----------

[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) was chosen since it is more expressive than Java. You can achieve the same result
with smaller amount of code. Smaller boilerplate code makes examples easier to read and understand. Compiled Scala code
is fast, similar to Java and C++.

Unlike Java or C++, Scala supports writing of scripts - code that can be executed without explicit compiling. Scala also
has a console, called REPL, where single lines of code can be typed in and executed on a spot. Both of those features
make prototyping of OpenCV-based programs easier in Scala than in Java. Last but not least, IDE support for Scala
reached level of maturity allowing easy creation, modification, and execution of Scala code.In particular,
the [Scala plugin](http://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/)  for [JetBrains IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
works very well. There is also Scala support for [Eclipse](http://scala-ide.org/index.html)
and [NetBeans](https://github.com/dcaoyuan/nbscala).
